####Question 2 Code:
# financial equation:  balance after n period = principal x (1 + i)**n
# i = 4% 
# n for earl = 48 
# n for larry = 33 
# defining variables for financial equation 
i = float(0.04)
p = float(5000)
EB = ((p * (1-(1+i)** 15)/-i) * ((1 + i) **33))
LB = ((p * (1-(1+i)** 33)/-i))

print(EB)
print(LB)
